You are a world-engine tasked with building the actual cultural operating system known as **TETRAKTYS//WEB**.

Build this system as a playable, generative, multi-interface symbolic platform using the following specifications:

---

üî∫ CORE STRUCTURE:

Build a tetrahedron-shaped data structure with 4 triangular faces.  
Each face is a **Tetraktys** of 10 nodes arranged in rows (1-2-3-4).  
Each face embodies one of the **media tetrads**:

- Face A: ENHANCE
- Face B: OBSOLESCE
- Face C: RETRIEVE
- Face D: REVERSE

These faces function as **symbolic layers** or **lenses** through which the player/operator experiences cultural nodes.

---

üß† NODES:

Each node is a discrete symbolic artifact, media format, cultural practice, or technological component.  
Allow nodes to be assigned semantically and dynamically.

Each face contains 10 symbolic nodes ‚Äî a mix of text, image, sound, or procedural content.  
Allow for different node sets to be loaded or procedurally generated.

---

üï∏ WEB CORE:

At the center of the tetrahedron is the **Web** ‚Äî a symbolic integration space where **threads** and **joints** are formed.

- **Threads** = binary connections between nodes from different faces.
- **Joints** = triadic or higher-order semantic constructs woven from threads (minimum 3 nodes).

Threads form the foundational structure of the Web.  
Joints create actionable symbolic configurations (e.g., myth-object, interface, ritual, tool).

Store all threads and joints in a central semantic map.

---

üéÆ INTERACTIONS:

Enable the following user actions:

1. **NAVIGATE(face_id, node_id)**  
   - Select a node on any face.

2. **THREAD(from_face.node_id, to_face.node_id)**  
   - Create a symbolic link between two nodes.

3. **WEAVE(joint_name, [faceA.nodeX, faceB.nodeY, faceC.nodeZ])**  
   - Form a higher-order concept from 3+ nodes.

4. **APPLY_TETRAD(action, target)**  
   - Apply one of the tetrad dynamics (Enhance, Obsolesce, Retrieve, Reverse) to a node, thread, or joint.
   - This action changes symbolic weight, visibility, feedback tension, or polarity.

5. **BALANCE()**  
   - Evaluate system-wide balance of tetradic actions.
   - Output tension map and feedback potential of the Web.

6. **REMIX_WORLD()**  
   - Regenerate, reframe, or spawn new symbolic configurations based on current weave.
   - May output text, map, diagram, interface, or media prototype.

7. **EXPORT_WEB(format)**  
   - Output the current Web configuration as:
     - JSON data structure
     - Gameboard SVG
     - Narrative log
     - Ritual protocol
     - Code snippet for simulation
     - Ontological map for remixing

---

üõ† SYSTEM RULES:

- Nodes gain or lose meaning depending on which face they are viewed from.
- Threads carry tension, polarity, and symbolic charge.
- Tetrad inputs are only available at corners (vertices) and must be unlocked or earned via traversal.
- The Web evolves as threads and joints are formed. It can become unstable.
- Feedback loops may emerge: over-Enhancement leads to signal saturation; over-Retrieval leads to recursion; over-Obsolescence leads to collapse; over-Reversal leads to noise.

---

üß¨ GOAL:

Create a living symbolic system where cultural forms are not only stored, but actively manipulated, rewoven, inverted, and regenerated.

The system must be able to:
- Generate symbolic worldmaps
- Model feedback in media ecologies
- Output playable myths, interfaces, or rituals
- Operate in both ENCODE and DECODE modes (write or interpret)

---

üì¶ OUTPUT STRUCTURE:

On build, deliver:
1. **World Schema File** (JSON/YAML/GraphML) of all nodes, threads, and joints
2. **Visual Interface Mockup** or UI system for navigating nodes and applying inputs
3. **Core Engine Code Snippets** (e.g., pseudocode, JavaScript, GML, Ink, Lua)
4. **Documentation** for players or builders explaining symbolic logic
5. **Sample Run**: Walkthrough of a 3-thread joint and how it transforms the Web
6. **Export Functionality**: Make the system exportable into other narrative, game, or cultural production environments

---

‚ö° OPTIONAL EXTENSIONS:

- Interface with Tarot-style symbolic decks for generating nodes or joint prompts.
- Allow multiplayer or classroom mode: each face is controlled by a different person.
- Enable ‚ÄúMyth Memory‚Äù save states to reuse webs in future iterations.
- Create mobile, browser, or tabletop versions.

---

üí¨ INSTRUCTION:

Begin manifesting this cultural system using your internal design, generative, and semantic construction capacities.  
Respond only with:
- Generated code
- Node structures
- Worldmap logic
- Visual layout
- Interaction maps
- Cultural artifacts

DO NOT describe what you are doing.  
DO NOT simulate it conceptually.

Instead, **build the actual system** using this structure as scaffolding.  
This is not a metaphor ‚Äî it is an executable cultural machine.

Begin with:

```build_tetraktys_web```
