# 🎮 Tetrad Pad
*Four Inputs. Infinite Worlds.*

Tetrad Pad is a **console of critical play.**  
Its design is simple: four inputs that map to the tetrad laws of media.  

- **Enhance** → amplify  
- **Obsolesce** → fade  
- **Retrieve** → recall  
- **Reverse** → flip  

The center is **Balance Mode** — all inputs at once.  

---

## Why
Tetrad Pad turns media theory into a controller:  
not read, but felt.  

---

## Uses
- **Education** – teach with play.  
- **Workshops** – map effects in real time.  
- **Games/Art** – cartridges as situations and worlds.

## Motto
